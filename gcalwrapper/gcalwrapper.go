// Convenience wrapper for Google Calendar API V3

/*
TODO
This will start off as part of the showCal project, but should probably
be spun into its own package down the road. It will also initially
include the OAuth2 and GCal bits in this one file, but those will
likely be split into two files (in the same package) when I'm closer
to completing this component
